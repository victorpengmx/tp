## Quick Start

### Tutorial: Installing Connectify

Getting started with Connectify is extremely simple! Here is a tutorial on how to set up Connectify in **4 easy steps**.

1. Firstly, ensure that you have *Java 11* or above [installed](https://www.baeldung.com/java-check-is-installed) in your Computer.
2. Create a new folder to store Connectify.
3. Download Connectify from following [**this link**](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-T15-4/tp/releases) and save the downloaded file in the directory you created in the previous step.
4. Launch Connectify by double-clicking the file in the directory. You'll be greeted by Connectify's primary interface, with an empty database as shown below.

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-warning"><strong>&#x2757; Caution:</strong>
For MAC users, if an error message popup appears, running 'java -jar connectify.jar' while in the same directory via the MAC command terminal instead will open Connectify.
</div>

### Tutorial: Navigating the application

* Connectify uses a [Command Line Interface (CLI)](#glossary-command-line-interface-cli) - which means that you perform actions by entering [commands](#glossary-command) for Connectify to carry out. If you want to find out more on how to make use of commands, you can jump ahead to learn the [components of a command](#components-of-a-command).
* Once a command has been successfully carried out, Connectify will display the results accordingly.
* Refer to the diagrams in the following pages to find out about the different components of Connectify that are responsible for receiving commands, displaying results, and more!

### Tutorial: Adding your first connection

Now that you've familiarized yourself with the Connectify interface, it's time to start connecting with people. This step-by-step guide will walk you through the process of adding your first connection to Connectify in **three simple steps**. You can choose to follow the sample instructions verbatim, or you can get creative and use your details.

The guide begins on the following page!

As a new user, your Connectify database is **empty**. Let's add your first connection!

1. Firstly, you should input a company into your database. The example that we would be using is `addCompany n/Apple Inc i/Technology l/Silicon Valley d/computer and consumer technology w/www.apple.com e/apple@gmail.com p/98765432 a/1 Infinite Loop, Cupertino, California`. This command adds a company named "Apple Inc" to your Connectify database with the relevant details of the company as specified in the command. The output of this command is shown below:

   ```
   New company added: Apple Inc
   Industry: Technology
   Location: Silicon Valley
   Description: computer and consumer technology
   Website: www.apple.com
   Email: apple@gmail.com
   Phone: 98765432
   Address: 1 Infinite Loop, Cupertino, California
   ```

   The company has been successfully added to your Connectify database! You should be able to see the company in your database as shown below:

   ![Adding First Company](images/tutorial_addingFirstCompany.png)

2. Now that you've added a company to your Connectify database, it's time to add a person to your database. The example that we would be using is `addPerson n/John Doe p/98765432 e/johnd@example.com a/311, Clementi Ave 2, #02-25 t/friends t/owesMoney c/1 pr/1`. This command adds a person named "John Doe" to your Connectify database with the relevant details of the person as specified in the command. The output of this command is shown below:

   ```
   New person added: John Doe;
   Phone: 98765432;
   Email: johnd@example.com;
   Address: 311, Clementi Ave 2, #02-25;
   Note: Priority: 1;
   Company: Apple Inc;
   Tags: [owesMoney][friends]
   ```

   The person has been successfully added to your Connectify database! You should be able to see the person in your database as shown below:

    ![Adding First Person](images/tutorial_addingFirstPerson.png)

## Features

### Components of a Command

Every command in Connectify is a prompt for action. It's how you command the application to organize your network. Let's understand the different components of a command!

![UG Command Example](images/UGCommandExample.png)

* Command Name<br>
  The **command name** indicates the action you want to perform in Connectify.<br>
  In the example above, `editCompany` is the command name.

* Index<br>
  The **index** is the **numerical position** of an item in a displayed list within Connectify. <br>
  In the example above, `1` represents the first company in the company list.

* Prefixes<br>
  Prefixes ending with a `/` help identify the type of information **you provide** in a command. <br>
  In the example above, `n/`serves as a prefix to indicate that you want to edit a company's name to `Facebook`.

* Inputs<br>
  Inputs are the specific details **you input** for a command to process. <br>
  In the example above, `Facebook` is the input that specifies the new name for the company.

### How to Read Command Formats

Throughout this user guide, you'll encounter various [General Commands](#general-commands) specific to Connectify. Let's explore how to interpret these command formats.

* Providing User Inputs<br>
  Any words in **capital letters** are **your supplied inputs**.
  For instance, in `editPerson INDEX c/COMPANY`, you can type in `editPerson 1 c/Apple n/Ryan`.

* Optional Inputs<br>
  Inputs enclosed within square brackets `[]` are **optional**.
  For instance, for the command `editPerson INDEX c/COMPANY [n/NAME]`, you can use it in two ways:
  `editPerson INDEX c/COMPANY n/Ryan` or simply as `editPerson INDEX c/COMPANY`.

      </path>
    </svg>
  </span>
</a>

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### General Input Guidelines

Here are some guidelines when using any of Connectify's commands. Please follow this to ensure that Connectify understands you!

* Flexible Input Order<br>
  You can key in inputs **that are accompanied by a prefix** in **any order**.<br>
  For example, a command might be structured as `w/WEBSITE e/EMAIL`, but entering `e/EMAIL w/WEBSITE` will work as well.

* Fixed Order for Index Specification<br>
  When specifying an index, **the index must be the first input**.<br>
  For example, `1 n/Apple` is valid, but `n/Apple 1` is not.
  When there are two indexes (PersonIndex and CompanyIndex), **the PersonIndex must come before the CompanyIndex**.<br>
  For example, `1 2 n/Apple` is  referring to the person with index 1 and company with index 2, but `2 1 n/Apple` is referring to the person with index 2 and company with index 1.

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-warning"><strong>&#x2757; Caution:</strong>
It's important to avoid including inputs that are not expected by a command. For example, if a 'rank' command is designed to accept zero inputs, adding an input like 'p/12345678' might lead to unintended behaviour.

### Features for managing company details

#### Adding a company: `addCompany`

The **addCompany** command allows you to add new companies to your Connectify database. To add a company's details, follow the format below:

`addCompany n/NAME i/INDUSTRY l/LOCATION d/DESCRIPTION w/WEBSITE e/EMAIL p/PHONE a/ADDRESS`

The fields are:
- `n/NAME` is the name of the Company.
- `i/INDUSTRY` is the industry the Company is in.
- `l/LOCATION` is the location of the Company.
- `d/DESCRIPTION` is a description of the Company.
- `w/WEBSITE` is the website of the Company.
- `e/EMAIL` is the email address of the Company.
- `p/PHONE` is the phone number of the Company.
- `a/ADDRESS` is the address of the Company.

Note:
- Connectify only supports alphanumeric characters (incl. spaces) for names.
- Connectify only supports alphanumeric characters for tags.
- There are no restrictions on the input for the website field as it is for the user's preference. This means that websites can be successfully inputted even without the `www` prefix.
- All fields are case-sensitive. This means that `Apple Inc` and `apple inc` are considered different names.

**Example:**

To add a Company "Apple Inc", a computer and consumer technology company headquartered in Los Altos, with the website "www.apple.com", email address contact@apple.com, the phone number 98765432, address "1 Apple Park Way, Cupertino, California", use the following command:

```
addCompany n/Apple Inc i/technology l/Los Altos d/computer and consumer technology w/www.apple.com e/contact@apple.com p/98765432 a/1 Apple Park Way, Cupertino, California
```

**Successful Output:**

```
New company added: Apple Inc
Phone: 98765432
Email: contact@apple.com
Address: 1 Apple Park Way, Cupertino, California
Industry: technology
Location: Los Altos
Description: computer and consumer technology
Website: www.apple.com

### Advanced Data Management Features

#### Saving your data

Connectify will automatically save your data on your hard disk after any command that changes it. There is no need for you to manually save your data.

#### Editing your data file

You can directly modify Connectify's data without opening the application. You can do so by editing the Connectify [JSON file](https://fileinfo.com/extension/json) `[JAR file location]/data/addressbook.json`.

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-warning"><strong>&#x2757; Caution:</strong>
If your edited data is not of the correct format, Connectify will <b>be unable to read your data</b> and start with an empty JSON file the next time you launch Connectify.

## FAQ

**Q1: How do I navigate around Connectify's UI?**

A: Connectify's UI consists of 3 tabs. The first tab shows a detailed view of all companies and their associated person. The person tab shows a detailed view of each person and the company that they belong to. The companies tab shows a view of the various companies within Connectify. Since this companies tab aims to only show a simplified view, each company card only shows the basic fields such as name, phone, address, tags and people. The note section comes below the people list. For a more detailed view of each company, you can click on the company card to view the company's details in the first tab.

**Q2: What is considered a duplicate in Connectify?**

A: In Connectify, companies and people are considered duplicates if they share the same name as an existing company or person. Note that this condition holds for names that have the same letters but different cases. For example, `John` is considered different from `john`.

**Q3: Why are my fields being cut off in the UI?**

A: Do note that Connectify's UI does not fully support long fields and will cut off fields that are too long. However, the supported length is likely sufficient for most fields.

**Q4: What sort of input is not allowed in Connectify?**

A: Connectify does not impose strict input validation on the fields of companies and people, other than basic ones such as Names needing to be alphanumeric, not blank, and case-sensitive unique, while phone numbers must be numeric. Stricter input validation will be implemented in future versions of Connectify.

**Q5: What if one of my contacts belongs to multiple companies?**

A: Connectify does not support the same person being associated with multiple companies at our current version. This is to avoid confusion when sharing contacts with others. However, we are looking to implement this feature in future versions of Connectify.

**Q6: Should a person of higher priority be assigned a higher or lower priority number?**

A: A person of a higher priority should be assigned a higher priority number. This is because Connectify's `rank` command ranks people by decreasing numerical values of priority. Hence, a person with priority 10 will be ranked higher (closer to the top of the list) than a person with priority 1. The numerical range for the priority field is 1 to 10.

**Q7: What is the numerical range for the priority field?**

A: Connectify does not restrict the upper boundary of the numerical range for the priority field. This is so that a person who has ranked contacts of the highest priority at point in time wouldn't need to re-rank their contacts if they wish to add a new contact of an even higher priority in the future. However, the numerical value for priority cannot be a negative number.

## Known issues

1. When entering some commands incorrectly, the displayed error message will refer to "address book" instead of 'Connectify'. "address book" in such cases should be interpreted as "Connectify".
2. Some labels in the Connectify interface refer to "addressbook" instead of "Connectify". Connectify can also be seen as an improved version of an address book and such occurrences do not affect functionality.
3. Some company details cannot be seen in the Company Card under the **Company List tab**. This is due to the limited space in the Company Card. However, the details can be seen via the Company Card under **All tab**.
