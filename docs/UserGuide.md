## Features

### Adding Contacts

#### Command: `add`

The **add** command allows you to add new contacts to your Connectify database. Follow the format below to add contacts:

`add n/NAME e/EMAIL [t/TAG]…`

- `n/NAME`: Specify the name of the contact.
- `e/EMAIL`: Add the email address of the contact.
- `t/TAG`: Optionally, you can include tags to categorize your contacts. Tags help you organize your connections efficiently.

**Example:**

To add a contact named John Doe with the email address johndoe@example.com and tag them as "colleague," use the following command:

```
Add n/John Doe e/johndoe@example.com t/colleague
```

**Successful Output:**

```
Got it. I've added this contact:
John Doe
Email:
```

**Unsuccessful Output:**

```
Please provide a valid email address.
```

### Deleting Contacts

#### Command: `deletePerson`

The **deletePerson** command allows you to remove contacts from your Connectify database. To delete a contact, you need to specify the contact's index.

```
deletePerson INDEX
```

- `INDEX`: Provide the index of the contact you want to delete.

**Example:**

To delete the contact named John Doe at index 1, use the following command:
```
deletePerson 1
```

**Successful Output:**

```
Noted. I've removed this contact:
John Doe
Email:
```

**Unsuccessful Output:**

```
Please provide a valid index.
```

### Listing Contacts

#### Command: `list`

The **list** command enables you to view all the contacts you've added to your Connectify database.

```
list
```

**Successful Output:**

```
Here are the contacts in your list:
1. John Doe
Email:
```

**Unsuccessful Output:**

```

Running this command will display a list of all your contacts, including their names, email addresses, and any tags you've assigned to them.
