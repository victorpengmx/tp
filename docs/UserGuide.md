## Quick start

Getting started with Connectify is extremely simple! Here is a tutorial on how to set up Connectify in **4 easy steps**.

1. Firstly, ensure that you have *Java `11`* or above [installed](https://www.baeldung.com/java-check-is-installed) in your Computer.
2. Create a new folder to store Connectify.
3. Download Connectify from the following [**this link**](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-T15-4/tp/releases) and save the downloaded file in the directory you created in the previous step.
4. Launch Connectify by double-clicking the file in the directory. For MAC users, if an error message popup appears, running `java -jar connectify.jar` instead will open Connectify. You'll be greeted by Connectify's primary interface, with an empty database as shown below.
  <p style="text-align:center;"><img src="images/ConnectifyStartPage.png" width="500" /></p> <br>

## Tutorial: Adding your first connection

Now that you've familiarized yourself with the Connectify interface, it's time to start connecting with people. This step-by-step guide will walk you through the process of adding your first connection to Connectify in three simple steps. You can choose to follow the sample instructions verbatim, or you can get creative and use your own details.

The guide begins on the following page!

As a new user, your Connectify database is empty. Let's add your first connection!

1. Firstly, you should input a company into your database. The example that we would be using is `addCompany n/Apple Inc i/Technology l/Silicon Valley d/computer and consumer technology w/www.apple.com e/apple@gmail.com p/98765432 a/1 Infinite Loop, Cupertino, California`. This command adds a company named "Apple Inc" to your Connectify database with the relevant details of the company as specified in the command. The output of this command is shown below:


   ```
   New company added: Apple Inc
   Industry: Technology
   Location: Silicon Valley
   Description: computer and consumer technology
   Website: www.apple.com
   Email: apple@gmail.com
   Phone: 98765432
   Address: 1 Infinite Loop, Cupertino, California
   ```

   The company has been successfully added to your Connectify database! You should be able to see the company in your database as shown below:

   ![Adding First Company](images/tutorial_addingFirstCompany.png)

2. Now that you've added a company to your Connectify database, it's time to add a person to your database. The example that we would be using is `addPerson n/John Doe p/98765432 e/johnd@example.com a/311, Clementi Ave 2, #02-25 t/friends t/owesMoney c/1 pr/1`. This command adds a person named "John Doe" to your Connectify database with the relevant details of the person as specified in the command. The output of this command is shown below:

   ```
   New person added: John Doe;
   Phone: 98765432;
   Email: johnd@example.com;
   Address: 311, Clementi Ave 2, #02-25;
   Note: Priority: 1;
   Company: Apple Inc;
   Tags: [owesMoney][friends]
   ```

   The person has been successfully added to your Connectify database! You should be able to see the person in your database as shown below:

    ![Adding First Person](images/tutorial_addingFirstPerson.png)

### Advanced Data Management Features

#### Saving your data

Connectify will automatically save your data on your hard disk after any command that changes it. There is no need for you to manually save your data.

#### Editing your data file

You can directly modify Connectify's data without opening the application. You can do so by editing the Connectify [JSON file](https://fileinfo.com/extension/json) `[JAR file location]/data/addressbook.json`.

<box type="warning" icon=":fa-solid-triangle-exclamation:">

**Warning**
If your edited data is not of the correct format, Connectify will **discard all of your data** and start with an empty JSON file the next time you launch Connectify. This is **irreversible**, so please **ensure that you have backed up your data** before editing it.

## FAQ

**Q1: How do I navigate around Connectify's UI?**

A: Connectify's UI consists of 3 tabs. The first tab shows a detailed view of all companies and their associated person. The person tab shows a detailed view of each person and the company that they belong to. The companies tab shows a view of the various companies within Connectify. Since this companies tab aims to only show a simplified view, each company card only shows the basic fields such as name, phone, address, tags and people. The note section comes below the people list. For a more detailed view of each company, you can click on the company card to view the company's details in the first tab.

**Q2: What is considered a duplicate in Connectify?**

A: In Connectify, companies and people are considered duplicates if they share the same name as an existing company or person. Note that this condition holds for names that have the same letters but different cases. For example, `John` is considered different from `john`.

**Q3: Why are my fields being cut off in the UI?**

A: Do note that Connectify's UI does not fully support long fields and will cut off fields that are too long. However, the supported length is likely sufficient for most fields. 

**Q4: What sort of inputs are not allowed in Connectify?**

A: Connectify does not impose strict input validation on the fields of companies and people, other than basic ones such as Names needing to be alphanumeric, not blank, and case-sensitive unique, while phone numbers must be numeric. Stricter input validation will be implemented in future versions of Connectify.

**Q5: What if one of my contacts belongs to multiple companies?**

A: Connectify does not support the same person being associated with multiple companies at our current version. This is to avoid confusion when sharing contacts with others. However, we are looking to implement this feature in future versions of Connectify.

**Q6: Should a person of higher priority be assigned a higher or lower priority number?**

A: A person of a higher priority should be assigned a higher priority number. This is because Connectify's `rank` command ranks people by decreasing numerical values of priority. Hence, a person with priority 10 will be ranked higher (closer to the top of the list) than a person with priority 1. The numerical range for the priority field is 1 to 10.

**Q7: What is the numerical range for the priority field?**

A: Connectify does not restrict the numerical range for the priority field. However, the numerical range for the priority field is 1 to 10. This is because Connectify's `rank` command ranks people by decreasing numerical values of priority. This is so that a person who has ranked contacts of the highest priority at point in time wouldn't need to re-rank their contacts if they wish to add a new contact of an even higher priority in the future. However, the numerical value for priority should not be a negative number.

## Known issues

1. When entering some commands incorrectly, the displayed error message will refer to "address book" instead of 'Connectify'. "address book" in such cases should be interpreted as "Connectify".
2. Some labels in the Connectify interface refer to "addressbook" instead of "Connectify'. Such occurences do not affect functionality.
