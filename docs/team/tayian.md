### Project: Connectify

Connectify is a networking platform designed to help professionals efficiently manage their connections and enhance their networking experiences. The user interacts with it using a CLI, and it also has a GUI. It is written in Java.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **New Feature**: Created attributes to be extended by Company and Person Class
* Created and organised the attributes: Address, Email, Industry, Location, Name, Phone, Website.
* Extended the attributes to create PersonAddress, CompanyAddress, PersonEmail, CompanyEmail, etc. classes.
* Added test cases for the Company and Person class to verify that the attributes are working as intended.
* Significance: Refactored the Company class according to OOP principles.

* **New Feature**: Implemented `sharePerson` Command
* Implemented the `sharePerson` command, enabling users to retrieve instructions on how to add a particular Person.
* This feature allows users to share these people with others, allowing effective network management through creating second- and third-degree connections.
* Key contributions: Enhanced the platform's utility for managing relationships with other professionals.

* **New Feature**: Implemented `shareCompany` Command
* Developed the `shareCompany` command, allowing users to add notes to their company contacts.
* This feature allows users to share these companies with others, allowing effective network management through disseminating information about companies, gleaned through interaction with their employees.
* Significance: Enhanced the platform's utility for managing professional relationships with organizations.

* **Project management**:
    * Resolved merge conflicts that arose due to parallel editing of similar features.
    * Identified bugs in code and informed team members.

* **Documentation**:
    * User Guide:
        * Updated documentation for User Guide to inform expected behavior for `addCompany` commands.
    * Developer Guide:
        * Updated documentation for User Guide to include Appendix: Instructions for Manual Testing.
        * Added diagrams for the `addCompany`, `deleteCompany` command.

* **Team-Based Tasks**:
    * **Enhanced Code Robustness through Gradle Assertions**: Consistently ensured a maintaining, or increase in code coverage, for all code I have directly implemented, to bolster code robustness and catch possible unexpected behavior.

* **Tools**:
    * **Leveraged PlantUML for Diagram Creation**: Utilized PlantUML to generate meaningful diagrams for the Developer Guide, making it more visually informative for future Developers.
    * **Used CodeCov for Code Coverage**: Utilized CodeCov to track code coverage and ensure that the project meets the minimum code coverage requirements.
