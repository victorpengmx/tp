* Created and implemented the UI component for the entire project.
* Learned and familiarized myself with JavaFX  to create the UI.
* Significance: The UI is a fundamental component of the project, as it allows users to interact with the project.

* **New Feature**: Implemented `PersonPriority` [\#80](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-T15-4/tp/issues/80) [(Link to Pr)](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-T15-4/tp/pull/92)
* Added a `PersonPriority` class to the project.
* Done by creating a `Priority `abstract class.
* This feature allows users to prioritize their contacts and supports the `rank` command.
* Significance: Priority is a fundamental feature of Connectify, as it allows users to prioritize their contacts.

* **New Feature**: Implemented `list`, `people` and `companies` [\#47](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-T15-4/tp/issues/47) [\#55](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-T15-4/tp/issues/55) [(Link to PR)](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-T15-4/tp/pull/58)
* Added the `list`, `people` and `companies` commands to Connectify.
* Added the relevant tests for the commands and support in the UI for auto switching to the relevant tab.
* This feature allows users to view the different categories of contacts.
* Significance: The commands are a fundamental component of the project, as they allow users to view the different categories of contacts.

* **New Feature**: Implemented `editPerson` [\#69](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-T15-4/tp/issues/69) [(Link to PR)](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-T15-4/tp/pull/76)
* Added the `editPerson` command to Connectify.
* This was done using by also creating the `editPersonDescriptor` class.
* This feature allows users to edit the details of their contacts within the `personList` of a `company`.
* Significance: This command allows users to edit the details of their contacts.

* **Code contributed**: [RepoSense link](https://nus-cs2103-ay2324s1.github.io/tp-dashboard/?search=T15-4&sort=groupTitle&sortWithin=title&timeframe=commit&mergegroup=&groupSelect=groupByRepos&breakdown=true&checkedFileTypes=docs~functional-code~test-code&since=2023-09-22&tabOpen=true&tabType=authorship&tabAuthor=nreHieW&tabRepo=AY2324S1-CS2103T-T15-4%2Ftp%5Bmaster%5D&authorshipIsMergeGroup=false&authorshipFileTypes=docs~functional-code~test-code&authorshipIsBinaryFileTypeChecked=false&authorshipIsIgnoredFilesChecked=false)

* **Project management**:
    * Handled issue creation on GitHub for certain weeks.
    * Conducted prompt and efficient issue resolution and pull request reviews.

* **Enhancements to existing features**: Implemented the 2 way association between `Person` and `Company` [\#112](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-T15-4/tp/issues/112) [(Link to PR)](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-T15-4/tp/pull/119)
* Implemented the 2 way association between `Person` and `Company`.
* Not only does a Company now have a list of `Person`, but a `Person` also has a reference to the `Company` they are associated with.
* Cleaned up the associated tests and command to support the new association.
* Significance: The association models the fundamental relationship between a `Person` and a `Company`, thereby allowing all the commands to behave in a more intuitive manner.

* **Enhancements to existing features**: Cleaned up the entire testing suite [\#114](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-T15-4/tp/issues/114) [(Link to PR)](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-T15-4/tp/pull/119)
* Cleaned up the entire testing suite, especially the storage tests.
* Significance: Testing is a fundamental component of the Project and is also a key learning outcome of CS2103T.

* **Team-Based Tasks**:
