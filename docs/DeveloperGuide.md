## Introduction
Connectify is a desktop app for managing connections, optimized for use via a Command Line Interface (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you can type fast, Connectify can get your contact management tasks done faster than traditional GUI apps. 

This developer guide describes the implementation details of Connectify. It is intended for software developers who want to contribute to Connectify's development.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### **Setting up, getting started**

Refer to the guide [_Setting up and getting started_](SettingUp.md).

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **Design**

### Architecture

<puml src="diagrams/ArchitectureDiagram.puml" width="280" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App.

Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

**Main components of the architecture**

**`Main`** (consisting of classes [`Main`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java)) is in charge of the app launch and shut down.
* At app launch, it initializes the other components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down, it shuts down the other components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

The bulk of the app's work is done by the following four components:

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `deletePerson 1 1`.

<puml src="diagrams/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.puml" width="574" />

Each of the four main components (also shown in the diagram above),

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which follows the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface. Other components interact with a given component through its interface rather than the concrete class (reason: to prevent outside component's being coupled to the implementation of a component), as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.

<puml src="diagrams/ComponentManagers.puml" width="300" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

### UI component

The UI component in this application provides the graphical user interface for interacting with Connectify. It consists of several key classes, including `MainWindow`, `CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `EntityListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter`, `PersonCard` and `CompanyCard`. All these classes, along with `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class, which captures the common functionalities between parts of the GUI.

The UI component is built using the JavaFX UI framework, and the layout of UI parts is defined in matching `.fxml` files located in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the `MainWindow` is specified in `MainWindow.fxml`.

#### Class Structure

The main classes and their relationships in the UI component are as follows:

<puml src="diagrams/UiClassDiagram.puml" alt="Structure of the UI Component"/>

The UI consists of the following parts:
- `Ui`: The entry point of the UI component. It orchestrates the various UI elements.
- `MainWindow`: The primary UI window that houses all UI elements.
- `CommandBox`: The input box for user commands.
- `ResultDisplay`: The area that displays command results and system messages.
- `EntityListPanel`: The panel that displays a list of entities (e.g., persons and companies).
- `StatusBarFooter`: The status bar that shows system information.
- `UiPart`: An abstract class that captures common functionalities for UI components. It is inherited by all UI components.

#### Interaction with Other Components

The UI component interacts with other components in the application to fulfill its role:

- **Logic Component**: The UI component executes user commands by delegating them to the Logic component. It relies on the Logic component to process commands and provide responses.

- **Model Component**: The UI component listens for changes to the Model data, specifically the list of persons and companies to display. When the Model data is modified, the UI updates to reflect those changes. It displays information about persons and companies that reside in the Model component.

- **Dependencies**: The UI component has dependencies on various classes within the Model component to display data effectively.


#### Usage

To use the UI component effectively, follow these guidelines:

1. **Starting the UI**: To start the UI, the application initializes the `UiManager`, which is the entry point of the UI. It also creates a `MainWindow` and the associated UI elements.

2. **User Interaction**: Users interact with the UI by entering commands in the `CommandBox`. The UI component processes these commands and displays the results in the `ResultDisplay`.

3. **Display of Entities**: The `EntityListPanel` displays a list of entities. An `Entity` is either a Person or a Company. The `EntityListPanel` displays the entities in a scrollable list. The user can scroll through the list to view all the entities.

4. **Listening for Model Changes**: The UI component actively listens for changes to the Model data. When the Model is updated, the UI reflects these changes, ensuring that the user sees the most current data.

5. **Error Handling**: The UI component handles errors gracefully and provides informative messages to the user when issues occur. These error messages are customised to the specific command the user has provided.

6. **Extending UI Components**: Developers can extend or modify existing UI components by creating new classes that inherit from UiPart. This allows for the addition of new GUI elements and functionality, making it easy to customize and enhance the user interface.

7. **Layout and Styling**: The layout of UI components is defined in matching `.fxml` files located in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the `MainWindow` is specified in `MainWindow.fxml`. The styling of UI components is defined in matching `.css` files located in the same folder. For example, the styling of the `MainWindow` is specified in `MainWindow.css`.


#### External Resources

- The API of this component is specified in [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-T15-4/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/connectify/ui/Ui.java).

- The layouts of UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files in the `src/main/resources/view` folder.

- For specific details about the implementation of the `MainWindow`, refer to [`MainWindow.java`](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-T15-4/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/connectify/ui/MainWindow.java).



### Logic component

**API** : [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java)

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component:

<puml src="diagrams/LogicClassDiagram.puml" width="550"/>

The sequence diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component, taking `execute("deletePerson 1 1")` API call as an example.

<puml src="diagrams/DeleteSequenceDiagram.puml" alt="Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `deletePerson 1 1` Command" />

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** The lifeline for `DeletePersonCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.
</box>

How the `Logic` component works:

1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it is passed to an `ConnectifyParser` object which in turn creates a parser that matches the command (e.g., `DeletePersonCommandParser`) and uses it to parse the command.
1. This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g., `DeletePersonCommand`) which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
1. The command can communicate with the `Model` when it is executed (e.g. to delete a person).
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned back from `Logic`.

Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:

<puml src="diagrams/ParserClasses.puml" width="600"/>

How the parsing works:
* When called upon to parse a user command, the `ConnectifyParser` class creates an `XYZCommandParser` (`XYZ` is a placeholder for the specific command name e.g., `AddPersonCommandParser`) which uses the other classes shown above to parse the user command and create a `XYZCommand` object (e.g., `AddPersonCommand`) which the `ConnectifyParser` returns back as a `Command` object.
* All `XYZCommandParser` classes (e.g., `AddPersonCommandParser`, `DeletePersonCommandParser`, ...) inherit from the `Parser` interface so that they can be treated similarly where possible e.g, during testing.

### Model component
**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-T15-4/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/connectify/model/Model.java)

<puml src="diagrams/ModelClassDiagram.puml" width="450" />

The main entities of Connectify are a `Person` and `Company` which both inherit from the `Entity` class. Such a relationship is to allow either a `Person` or `Company` to be displayed in the UI.
This relationship is modelled in the following diagram:

<img src="images/EntityClassDiagram.png" width="200" />


The `Model` component,

* stores Connectify data i.e., all `Person` objects (which are contained in a `UniquePersonList` object) and all `Company` objects (which are contained in a `UniqueCompanyList` object).
* stores the currently 'selected' `Person` objects (e.g., results of a search query) as a separate _filtered_ list which is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Person>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user’s preferences. This is exposed to the outside as a `ReadOnlyUserPref` objects.
* does not depend on any of the other three components (as the `Model` represents data entities of the domain, they should make sense on their own without depending on other components)

### Storage component

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-T15-4/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/connectify/storage/Storage.java)

<puml src="diagrams/StorageClassDiagram.puml" width="550" />

The `Storage` component,
* can save both address book data and user preference data in JSON format, and read them back into corresponding objects.
* inherits from both `AddressBookStorage` and `UserPrefStorage`, which means it can be treated as either one (if only the functionality of only one is needed).
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component (because the `Storage` component's job is to save/retrieve objects that belong to the `Model`)

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `connectify.commons` package.

## **Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented. The section first discusses the implementation of the features for managing companies, followed by the features for managing persons. Finally, the section discusses general features that are not specific to either companies or persons.

### Add Company Feature: `addCompany`

#### Implementation

This feature is facilitated by the `AddCompanyCommand` and `AddCompanyCommandParser` in the `Logic` component, and works as described below.

When given valid user input, the `AddCompanyCommandParser` will create a new `Company` object to add to the address book.

Consider a scenario where the user wishes to add a new company with various details into Connectify. The `AddCompanyCommand` takes in various parameters, such as `Name`, `Industry`, `Location`, description, `Website`, `Email`, `Phone`, `Address`
to create a new `Company` object.

<img src="images/addCompanyObjectDiagram.png" width="700" />

Consider an example of a valid `addCompany` command:

```plaintext
addCompany n/TechCorp i/Technology l/Silicon Valley d/Leading tech company w/www.techcorp.com e/contact@techcorp.com p/12345678 a/123 Tech St, Silicon Valley
```

The new objects in the final internal state after this example has been parsed are shown in the object diagram above.

The following activity diagrams detail the behavior of Connectify when a user inputs an addCompany command with valid syntax to be executed.

The `AddCompanyCommand` also handles scenarios where a company with the same details already exists in the address book. In such cases, the command throws a `CommandException` with an error message to inform the user.

<img src="images/addCompanyActivityDiagram.png" width="600" />

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>



### Delete Company Feature: `deleteCompany`

#### Implementation

This feature is facilitated by the `DeleteCompanyCommand` and `DeleteCompanyCommandParser` in the `Logic` component, and works as described below.

When given valid inputs, the `DeleteCompanyCommandParser` will delete a `Company` object at the provided index.

Consider a scenario where the user wishes to delete a company.

It requires a `targetIndex` parameter. This validates company index to ensure the company is present in the system.

If valid, the company is removed from the address book.

<img src="images/deleteCompanyObjectDiagram.png" width="450" />

Consider an example of a valid `deleteCompany` command:

```plaintext
deleteCompany 1
```

The new objects in the final internal state after this example has been parsed are shown in the object diagram above.

The following activity diagrams detail the behavior of Connectify when a user inputs a deleteCompany command with valid syntax to be executed.

The `DeleteCompanyCommand` also handles scenarios where a company index does not exist in the range of companies. In such cases, the command throws a `CommandException` with an error message to inform the user.

<img src="images/deleteCompanyActivityDiagram.png" width="600" />

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>



### Edit Company Feature: `editCompany`

#### Implementation

This feature is facilitated by the `EditCompanyCommand` and `EditCompanyCommandParser` in the `Logic` component, and works as described below.

When given valid inputs, `the EditCompanyCommandParser` will edit a `Company` object.

Consider a scenario where the user wishes to edit a company.

It requires a `CompanyIndex` parameter. This validates company index to ensure the company is present in the system.

If valid, a new company object is created with the updated details and then set to replace the old company object.

<img src="images/editCompanyObjectDiagram.png" width="700" />

Consider an example of a valid `editCompany` command:

```plaintext
editCompany 1 n/TechCorp p/91234567 e/techcorp@gmail.com a/123, Jurong West Ave 6, #08-111
```

The new objects in the final internal state after this example has been parsed are shown in the object diagram above.

The following activity diagrams detail the behavior of Connectify when a user inputs an `editCompany` command with valid syntax to be executed.

The `EditCompanyCommand` also handles scenarios where a company index does not exist in the range of companies. In such cases, the command throws a `CommandException` with an error message to inform the user.

<img src="images/editCompanyActivityDiagram.png" width="600" />

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>



### List Companies Command: `companies`

#### Implementation

The mechanism is facilitated by `ListCompaniesCommand` and `ConnectifyParser` in the `Logic` component, and works as described below.

Upon receiving a valid user input for the list companies command, `ConnectifyParser` returns a new `ListCompaniesCommand` object.

The `ListCompaniesCommand` object invokes `updateFilteredCompanyList` in `ModelManager` in the `Model` component with the predicate `PREDICATE_SHOW_ALL_COMPANIES` to communicate to the Model to display all Companies. Note that this command does not modify the internal list of Companies in the Model, only the displayed list.

If the list is empty, `execute` in the list command returns a `CommandResult` with `EMPTY_LIST_MESSAGE` or `MESSAGE_SUCCESS` otherwise.

The sequence diagram below illustrates the events that take place during the execution of `ListCompaniesCommand`.

![ListCompaniesActivityDiagram.png](images/ListCompaniesSequenceDiagram.png)

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>



### Add Note to Company Feature: `noteCompany`

#### Implementation

This feature is implemented by the `NoteCompanyCommand` and `NoteCompanyCommandParser` within the `Logic` component.

When the user provides valid input, the `NoteCompanyCommandParser` interprets the input to execute an `NoteCompanyCommand`, which in turn adds a note to a specific `Company` object in the address book.

Assume a user wants to add a note to a company's record. The `noteCompany` command requires the index of the company in the displayed list and the note content as parameters.

<img src="images/addCompanyNoteObjectDiagram.png" width="450" />

Consider an example where the user wishes to add a note indicating that a company is seeking frontend developers. The command input would be as follows:

```plaintext
noteCompany 1 r/Looking for aspiring frontend developers.
```
Upon execution, the `NoteCompanyCommand` appends the note to the company at the specified index. The object diagram above illustrates the final internal state after this example has been parsed.

The behavior of Connectify upon receiving a noteCompany command is described in the following activity diagram.

The `NoteCompanyCommand` also handles cases where the provided company index is not valid. It could be that the index does not correspond to any company in the current list view, or it is not a positive integer. Under such circumstances, the command throws a `CommandException` to inform the user.

<img src="images/addCompanyNoteActivityDiagram.png" width="600" />

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>



### Share Company's Contact Feature: `shareCompany`

#### Implementation

This feature is enabled by the `ShareCompanyCommand` and `ShareCompanyCommandParser` within the `Logic` component.

With valid input, the parser constructs a `ShareCompanyCommand` which, upon execution, generates a command string for sharing a company's contact details.

The `shareCompany` command takes the parameter `COMPANY_INDEX` to identify the specific company to be shared.

<img src="images/shareCompanyObjectDiagram.png" width="600" />

Consider a scenario where the user wishes to share a company's contact. The command input would be as follows:

```plaintext
shareCompany 1 
```
Upon execution, the `ShareCompanyCommand` retrieves the company's details and generates a shareable command string of the company at the specified company index. This string is then displayed to the user for copying.

The `ShareCompanyCommand` also handles cases where the provided person or company index is not valid. It could be that the index does not correspond to any company in the current list view, or it is not a positive integer. Under such circumstances, the command throws a `CommandException` to inform the user.

<img src="images/shareCompanyActivityDiagram.png" width="600" />

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>



### Add Person Feature: `addPerson`

#### Implementation

This feature is facilitated by the `AddPersonCommand` and `AddPersonCommandParser` in the `Logic` component, and works as described below.

When given valid user input, the `AddPersonCommandParser` will create a new `Person` object to add to the address book in the specified company.

Consider a scenario where the user wishes to add a new contact to a specific company with various details. The `AddPersonCommand` takes in various parameters, such as `Name`, `Phone`, `Email`, `Address`, and optional tags, to create a new `Person` object.

To ensure that a contact is added to the correct company, the command also takes an `Index` parameter specifying the company where the contact should be added. This ensures that the contact is associated with the intended company.

<img src="images/addPersonObjectDiagram.png" width="700" />

Consider an example of a valid `addPerson` command:

```plaintext
addPerson n/John Doe p/98765432 e/johnd@example.com a/311, Clementi Ave 2, #02-25 t/friends t/owesMoney c/1
```

The new objects in the final internal state after this example has been parsed are shown in the object diagram above.

The following activity diagrams detail the behavior of Connectify when a user inputs an `addPerson` command with valid syntax to be executed.

The `AddPersonCommand` also handles scenarios where a person with the same details already exists in the address book or the company specified via the company index parameter does not exist. In such cases, the command throws a `CommandException` with an error message to inform the user.

<img src="images/addPersonActivityDiagram.png" width="700" />

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>



### Delete Person Feature: `deletePerson`

#### Implementation

This feature is facilitated by the `DeletePersonCommand` and `DeletePersonCommandParser` in the `Logic` component, and works as described below.

When given valid inputs, `the DeletePersonCommandParser` will delete a `Person` object from a particular company list.

Consider a scenario where the user wishes to delete a person from a particular company list.

It requires two `Index` parameters: one for the company and another for the person within that company.

The command first validates company index to ensure the company is present in the system.

It then validates person index to ensure that the person selected is indeed in that company's list.

If valid, the person is removed from the designated company's list, and subsequently, from the address book.

<img src="images/deletePersonObjectDiagram.png" width="600" />

Consider an example of a valid `deletePerson` command:

```plaintext
deletePerson 1 1
```

The new objects in the final internal state after this example has been parsed are shown in the object diagram above.

The following activity diagrams detail the behavior of Connectify when a user inputs an `deletePerson` command with valid syntax to be executed.

The `DeletePersonCommand` also handles scenarios where a person is not part of a company or company index does not exist in the range of companies. In such cases, the command throws a `CommandException` with an error message to inform the user.

<img src="images/deletePersonActivityDiagram.png" width="700" />

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>



### Edit Person Feature: `editPerson`

#### Implementation

This feature is implemented by the `EditPersonCommand` and `EditPersonCommandParser` within the `Logic` component of Connectify.

The process is initiated when the user inputs a valid command to edit a person's details. The `EditPersonCommandParser` analyses the input and constructs an `EditPersonCommand`, which, upon execution, updates the attributes of the specified `Person` object.

The `editPerson` command requires an index to identify the target person within the displayed person list of a company. It also has to include a company index to specify which company the person is associated with, and any combination of fields to be updated for the person.

If both the person and company indexes are valid, the `EditPersonCommand` updates the person's attributes with the new values.

Consider an example where the user wants to update the name, phone number, and email of a person listed as the first contact within a company:

```plaintext
editPerson 1 c/1 n/NewName p/98765432 e/newemail@example.com
```

Should there be any issues, such as invalid indexes or missing fields, the EditPersonCommand throws a CommandException to notify the user.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>



### List People Command: `people`

#### Implementation

The mechanism is facilitated by `ListPeopleCommand` and `ConnectifyParser` in the `Logic` component, and works as described below.

Upon receiving a valid user input for the list people command, `ConnectifyParser` returns a new `ListPeopleCommand` object.

The `ListPeopleCommand` object invokes `updateFilteredPersonList` in `ModelManager` in the `Model` component with the predicate `PREDICATE_SHOW_ALL_PERSONS` to communicate to the Model to display all Persons. Note that this command does not modify the internal list of Persons in the Model, only the displayed list.

If the list is empty, `execute` in the list command returns a `CommandResult` with `EMPTY_LIST_MESSAGE` or `MESSAGE_SUCCESS` otherwise.

The sequence diagram below illustrates the events that take place during the execution of `ListPeopleCommand`.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>



### Add Note to Person Feature: `notePerson`

#### Implementation

This feature is implemented by the `NotePersonCommand` and `NotePersonCommandParser` within the `Logic` component.

When the user provides valid input, the `NotePersonCommandParser` interprets the input to execute an `NotePersonCommand`, which in turn adds a note to a specific `Person` object in the address book.

To ensure that a note is added to the person in the correct company, the command also takes an `Index` parameter specifying the company where the person note should be added. This ensures that the person note is associated with the intended company.

Assume a user wants to add a note to a company's record. The `notePerson` command requires the index of the company in the displayed list and the note content as parameters.

<img src="images/addPersonNoteObjectDiagram.png" width="600" />

Consider an example where the user wishes to add a note indicating that a person likes to swim. The command input would be as follows:

```plaintext
notePerson 1 1 r/Likes to swim.
```
Upon execution, the `NotePersonCommand` appends the note to the person at the specified person index, corresponding to the company at the specified company index. The object diagram above illustrates the final internal state after this example has been parsed.

The behavior of Connectify upon receiving a notePerson command is described in the following activity diagram.

The `NotePersonCommand` also handles cases where the provided person or company index is not valid. It could be that the index does not correspond to any company or person in the current list view, or it is not a positive integer. Under such circumstances, the command throws a `CommandException` to inform the user.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>



### Ranking People by Priority Feature: `rank`

#### Implementation

The ranking feature within Connectify is facilitated by the `RankPersonCommand` in the `Logic` component. The `rank` command sorts the list of all persons by their assigned priority, allowing users to manage and view contacts based on importance.

#### Command Usage

To initiate the ranking process, the following command is used:

```plaintext
rank
```

This command does not require any additional parameters, simplifying its execution.

Upon successful execution, Connectify outputs the list of people ranked according to their priority.

The sequence of actions undertaken by the rank command is delineated in the activity diagram provided below. This includes the retrieval of all persons, their sorting by priority, and the updating of the user interface to reflect the changes.

The `rank` command also handles cases where there are no people in the address book. The command throws a `CommandException` to inform the user.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>



### Share Person's Contact Feature: `sharePerson`

#### Implementation

This feature is enabled by the `SharePersonCommand` and `SharePersonCommandParser` within the `Logic` component.

With valid input, the parser constructs a `SharePersonCommand` which, upon execution, generates a command string for sharing a person's contact details.

The `sharePerson` command takes two parameters, `COMPANY_INDEX` and `PERSON_INDEX`, to identify the specific person within a company's list to be shared.

<img src="images/sharePersonObjectDiagram.png" width="300" />

Consider an example where the user wishes to share a person's contact. The command input would be as follows:

```plaintext
sharePerson 1 1
```
Upon execution, the `SharePersonCommand` retrieves the person's details and generates a shareable command string of the person at the specified person index, corresponding to the company at the specified company index. This string is then displayed to the user for copying.
The object diagram above illustrates the final internal state after this example has been parsed.

The behavior of Connectify upon receiving a sharePerson command is described in the following activity diagram.

The `SharePersonCommand` also handles cases where the provided person or company index is not valid. It could be that the index does not correspond to any company or person in the current list view, or it is not a positive integer. Under such circumstances, the command throws a `CommandException` to inform the user.

<img src="images/sharePersonActivityDiagram.png" width="600" />

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>



### List All Command: `list`

#### Implementation

The mechanism is facilitated by `ListAllCommand` and `ConnectifyParser` in the `Logic` component, and works as described below.

Upon receiving a valid user input for the list command, `ConnectifyParser` returns a new `ListAllCommand` object.

The `ListAllCommand` object invokes `updateFilteredPersonList` and `updateFilteredCompanyList` in `ModelManager` in the `Model` component with the predicates `PREDICATE_SHOW_ALL_PERSONS` and `PREDICATE_SHOW_ALL_COMPANIES` to communicate to the Model to display all Companies and Persons. Note that this command does not modify the internal list of Companies and Persons in the Model, only the displayed list.

If the list is empty, `execute` in the list command returns a `CommandResult` with `EMPTY_LIST_MESSAGE` or `MESSAGE_SUCCESS` otherwise.

The sequence diagram below illustrates the events that take place during the execution of `ListAllCommand`.

![ListAllActivityDiagram.png](images/ListAllSequenceDiagram.png)

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>



### Clearing the Database: `clear`

#### Implementation

The `clear` feature is managed by the `ClearCommand` in the `Logic` component. This command is utilized to remove all persons and companies from the Connectify database.

#### Command Usage
```plaintext
clear
```
After running this command, there will be confirmation that all entities have been removed. Cleared all persons and companies.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>



### Seeking Help: `help`

#### Implementation

The `help` command is executed by the `HelpCommand` which provides users with assistance and information on using Connectify, including a link to the user guide.

#### Command Usage
```plaintext
help
```
When triggered, it presents a help window or a link to the user guide.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>



### Exiting Connectify: `exit`

#### Implementation

Implemented by the `ExitCommand`, this command terminates the Connectify application, closing the session safely.

#### Command Usage
```plaintext
exit
```

After running this command, the application closes.

## **Appendix: Planned Enhancements**

### 1. Allowing a Person to be Added to Multiple Companies

**Problem:**
The current system restricts individuals to be associated with only one company, which proves problematic for management of contact for individuals affiliated with multiple organizations. This limitation hampers effective contact management and fails to represent the diverse professional affiliations of users accurately.

**Proposed Solution:**
Enhance the system to enable individuals to be associated with multiple companies, providing a more flexible and comprehensive representation of professional relationships. This can be achieved by allowing the Person object to hold a reference to the Company objects that it is associated with. By allowing Persons to be associated with multiple companies, Connectify aims to provide users with a more accurate and comprehensive representation of their professional relationships.
### 2. Improving User Interface for Longer Input Data

**Problem:**
The current user interface imposes constraints on the length of user-inputted data, leading to potential truncation and a suboptimal user experience. This limitation may compromise the integrity and completeness of information entered into the system.

**Proposed Solution:**
Revamp the user interface to overcome limitations on input data length. This involves redesigning input fields, expanding character limits, and optimizing the display to accommodate longer entries. By enhancing the interface's ability to handle extended user input, Connectify aims to improve usability, allowing users to input, view, and manage comprehensive information seamlessly.

### 3. Enhancing User-Friendly Error Messages

**Problem:**
Current error messages lack user-friendliness, making it challenging for users to understand and address issues within the application effectively. This can lead to user frustration, prolonged problem resolution, and a less-than-optimal overall user experience.

**Proposed Solution:**
Optimize error messages to be more user-friendly and intuitive. This involves crafting clear, concise, and informative messages that guide users in understanding the issue and taking appropriate corrective actions. Connectify aims to improve communication with users during error scenarios, ensuring a smoother user experience even when challenges arise.

### 4. Strengthening User Input Validation

**Problem:**
Connectify currently allows extensive flexibility in user inputs without thorough validation, potentially resulting in inaccurate or invalid data entries. This poses risks to data integrity and the reliability of information stored within the system.

**Proposed Solution:**
Implement a comprehensive user input validation system to ensure the accuracy and correctness of data entered into Connectify. This involves validating input formats, ranges, and constraints, as well as incorporating error feedback mechanisms to guide users towards valid entries. By striking a balance between flexibility and data integrity, Connectify aims to enhance the overall reliability and trustworthiness of the information it manages.

### 5. Enhancing User Interface for Clarity and Intuitiveness

**Problem:**
The current user interface lacks intuitiveness, hindering users' ability to navigate and comprehend existing data effectively. This can lead to a suboptimal user experience and challenges in utilizing the application to its full potential.

**Proposed Solution:**
Invest in a comprehensive redesign of the user interface to improve clarity and intuitiveness. This involves refining navigation structures, optimizing data presentation, and incorporating user-friendly design principles. Connectify aims to provide users with an interface that is not only visually appealing but also enhances their ability to understand, interact with, and derive value from the information stored within the application.
